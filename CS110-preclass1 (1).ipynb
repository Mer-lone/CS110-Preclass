Iterative Approach:A method of solving the palindrome by iteration will involve converting the all to the same case then comparing the word (moving left to right) with its inverse ( rearranging the letters of the word from right to left). This method will return True if the word is a palindrome; otherwise, it will return false.\n",

It starts by analyzing whether the first and the last characters are equal, if they are equal then it moves inwards to check the following characters. Otherwise it halts. It repeats this process till it gets to the center, if they is just one character left, then it is a palindrome. Here the base case is when the characters are not equal while the recursive case is bound by the condition when the characters are equal, then it reapplies the function to the followingcharacters and evaluates if they are equal.\n",

    "b. Check the length of the string, if it is equal to 0 or 1, return true. This is our base case because the fuction does not call itself.\n",
    "c. Else, compare the first character and the last character using indexing a[0]=a[-1]. If false then the word is not a palindrome. If true increase the starting index by 1 and decrease the ending index by one, and compare again. Keep moving inward and repeat the fucntion until you get to the center. if there is one middle character left, then the word is a palindrome because it reads the same both backward and forward. "
